Modern update to antique barometer/thermometer

I found this lovely old weather pane, with semi-working barometer, thermometer, and hygrometer in it, while thrift-shopping.

Cost me nz$8, if I remember correctly. It's a bit run down, and in all honesty I don't really have a use for the hygrometer or the barometer. They're just random numbers to me, and I'm pretty sure I get far more useful information from the internet. Both Alexa and Siri have better answers for me.
